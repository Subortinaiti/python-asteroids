# python-asteroids
My version of the Atari game "Asteroids" made in python.

Controls:
A-D, LEFT-RIGHT > steering

W-S, UP-DOWN > accellerate-brake (braking can be disabled)

SPACE > shoot (hold for continuous fire)

there are no collisions for the ship with the asteroids, so tecnically you cannot die. just play until you get bored, I guess.
